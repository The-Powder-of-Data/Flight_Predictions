# Flight_Predictions
This project aims to predict flight delay time 7 days in advance. 
For this project we have accessed US flight data from 2018 to 2019 for training. 
Our test data was the first week of flights in 2020. 

This project is a work in progres and still needs to be refactored and modularized.

### Data: 
#### Here is where we stored all the tables we generated for this project.
- db_extracts: 
    - This directory contains our initial random sample of 127,000 rows of data, as well as the flights_test table provided with the original repo of the project. 
- Exported_Tables:
    - This contains the final tables we will be using with our model, fully optimized and engineered as best as we could. 
- model_staging
    - This contains transformed data ready for modeling input

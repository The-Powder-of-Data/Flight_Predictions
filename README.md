# Flight_Predictions
This project aims to predict flight delay time 7 days in advance. 
For this project we have accessed US flight data from 2018 to 2019 for training. 
Our test data was the first week of flights in 2020.

### Data: 
#### Here is where we stored all the tables we generated for this project.
- D_F_Engineering:
    - This directory contains the tables of all our attempts at data & feature engineering.
- db_extracts: 
    - This directory contains our initial random sample of 127,000 rows of data, as well as the flights_test table provided with the original repo of the project. 
- Exported_Tables:
    - This contains the final tables we will be using with our model, fully optimized and engineered as best as we could. 

### Original Files: 
Contains the original files from the project repo, apart from the original data tables.

  
### Output: 
- Figures:
    - Contains the charts / data visualizations we generated 

- Models: 
    - Contains the various models we used while testing for the best accuracy 

### Scrap Files: 
- The documentation of our trials (and errors) throughout our process of feature engineering.
